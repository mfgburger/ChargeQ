# ChargeQ - MyCharge app

This app allows you to easily manage all charging settings of your electric vehicle! You can select the charging mode (eco for environmental- and battery friendly charging, or fast charge if you are on a hurry), see your charging details. Most importantly, the ChargeAssistant will take your trip information, make convenient charging choices for you and learn from your charging behaviour to make your experience even smoother! 

# ChargeQ - our mission

With the rise of electric car users, the electricity grids of cities are in distress - the grids were not built for such a large traffic! There is an immediate need to balance the charging behaviour of the citizens in order to ensure that everyone can charge whenever they want, wherever they want without having to worry that it will shut down the grid. 

We provide users with an app and our SmartAssistant, that uses our ChargeQ algorithms to calculate where the grid needs more power and to ensure a safe charging behaviour for the entire city. We also take into account the most battery-friendly charging behaviour for you - it's a win-win!

The algorithm runs on our trusty servers. Even though our algorithm is already pretty smart, we are developing a quantum algorithm that will increase the efficiency even more!

# Why quantum?

Quantum algorithms are uniquely suited towards complex optimization problems like ours. Using a quantum computer, we are able to calculate the optimal charging settings for all users in real-time - an important feat to ensure the grid stability!
